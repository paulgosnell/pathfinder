## Core Features Delivered

### 1. **Professional Coaching System (GROW Model)**

**What It Does:**
- Provides structured 50-minute coaching sessions that guide parents through a proven problem-solving framework
- Helps parents discover their own solutions rather than prescribing generic advice
- Adapts to each family's unique situation and challenges

**How It Works:**
The platform uses the GROW model, a gold-standard coaching framework:

- **Goal (10% of session)**: Clarifies what success looks like
  - "What would make this conversation useful for you today?"
  - Helps parents articulate their specific challenges

- **Reality (60% of session)**: Deep exploration of the current situation
  - Minimum 10-15 exchanges to fully understand context
  - "Tell me more about what happens when..."
  - "When does this happen most?"
  - Looks for patterns, exceptions, and strengths

- **Options (20% of session)**: Parent-generated solutions
  - "What options do you see?"
  - "What's worked before, even a little?"
  - Agent offers evidence-based strategies only after deep understanding

- **Will (10% of session)**: Concrete action plan
  - "What will you try first?"
  - "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you?"
  - Creates commitment to specific next steps

**Parent Experience:**
- Natural, therapeutic conversation (not Q&A)
