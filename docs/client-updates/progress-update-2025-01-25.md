# ADHD Support Agent - Progress Update
**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Project**: AI-Powered ADHD Therapeutic Support System
**Status**: Development Complete - Production Ready

---

> **‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE - October 2025 Update:**
> This progress report describes the system as of September 2025. Since then, the system has undergone a **major coaching transformation** (October 2025) moving from a transactional 3-4 question discovery approach to a full therapeutic coaching model using the GROW framework and OARS methodology. See [COACHING-METHODOLOGY.md](../COACHING-METHODOLOGY.md) for the current approach.

## Executive Summary

We have successfully developed and deployed a sophisticated AI-powered ADHD support system that provides evidence-based therapeutic guidance to parents of children with ADHD. The system is now fully operational with advanced safety protocols, comprehensive monitoring, and production-grade reliability.
