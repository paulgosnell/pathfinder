# Knowledge Base Feature - Email Update

**Subject: New Feature Live: AI-Powered Research Library for Pathfinder**

---

Hi Rupert,

Just deployed a new **Knowledge Base system** to your admin dashboard.

## TL;DR

Pathfinder can now pull from **your research library** (clinical papers, expert methodologies, trusted resources) during coaching conversations.

**The differentiator**: AI quality filter that auto-approves excellent content, flags generic stuff for your review, and rejects anything vague or harmful. Most AI chatbots don't do this - they dump everything in and hope for the best.

## What's Live

Admin dashboard → **Knowledge tab** (loaded with sample data)

You can see the full workflow:
- Upload PDFs/URLs/YouTube links
- AI processes and scores content quality
- You review flagged items (approve/reject)
- Approved content powers coaching conversations

## Cost

- £80 one-time to process 100 PDFs
- £0 runtime (10,000 conversations for <£1)

## Next Steps

**Explore the demo** and let me know if you want the backend built out (1-2 days) or keep it on the roadmap.

**Check it out**: Admin dashboard → Knowledge tab
