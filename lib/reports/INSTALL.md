# PDF Export Installation

## Required Packages

The PDF export functionality in `pdf-export.ts` requires the following packages to be installed:

```bash
npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable
npm install --save-dev @types/jspdf @types/jspdf-autotable
```

## Installation Status

**NOT YET INSTALLED** - Run the command above before using the PDF export features.

## Verification

After installation, verify the packages are in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "jspdf": "^2.x.x",
    "jspdf-autotable": "^3.x.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/jspdf": "^2.x.x",
    "@types/jspdf-autotable": "^3.x.x"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Install the packages (see command above)
2. Ensure Supabase Storage bucket `reports` is configured (run migration)
3. Test PDF generation with a sample report
4. Integrate with API routes (see README.md for examples)
