There has been no mention of data protection in my journey so far. I don't know why it needs their name, or how it will use it.\n\nI gave two names and the next question was 'Let's start with your oldest, Tom. What's his age or grade level?\n\nIt assumed the first name I gave was my oldest which could be an incorrect assumption. It uses American language (grade) which doesn't feel appropriate as I'm in the UK.\n\nIt asked me what are the top 2-3 challenges with my oldest son - but he is not the son I want to discuss, my youngest is the one diagnosed ADHD.\n\nI said none as he doesn't have any ADHD challenges. It then continued and asked what type of school he attends, do I have an IEP or 504 plan, how are his relationships with teachers?\n\nThis is not a relevant question for my oldest son who I don't need help with. It asks too many questions in one go. It provides US references which are not relevant as I'm in the UK. I tried to leave the chat to start again but this wasn't possible.
