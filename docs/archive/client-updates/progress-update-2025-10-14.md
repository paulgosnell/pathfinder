# ADHD Support Agent - Progress Update
**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Project**: Purpose-Based Session Types & Discovery Flow
**Status**: Production-Ready

---

## Executive Summary

Since our last update on October 13, 2025, we've completed a **fundamental shift** in how parents choose their coaching sessions. Instead of asking "How much time do you have?", we now ask "What brings you here today?" - making the experience more intuitive and purpose-driven.

### Key Achievements:
1. **Purpose-Based Session Selection**: 6 distinct session types based on what parents need right now
2. **Discovery Call Feature**: New dedicated onboarding flow for first-time users
3. **Smarter Time Estimates**: Each session type automatically suggests appropriate time based on its purpose
4. **Bug Fix**: Fixed critical issue where short sessions weren't actually shorter
5. **Voice Mode Enhancement**: Voice sessions now adapt based on session type and time

All changes are live and ready for user testing.

## ‚úÖ Major Achievements

### üéØ **PURPOSE-BASED SESSIONS: "What brings you here today?"**

#### **The Problem We Solved**
Our previous approach asked parents to choose session length (5, 15, 30, 50 minutes) before starting. This had several issues:

**It put the burden on parents to estimate time needed**:
- "Is my homework problem a 15-minute issue or a 30-minute issue?"
- Parents don't know how long their issue will take to explore
- Choosing wrong time meant either rushing or wasting time

**It didn't match how parents think about their needs**:
- Parents think: "I need help with bedtime routines" (purpose-based)
- Not: "I have 30 minutes available" (time-based)

**It missed important use cases**:
- No clear onboarding path for new users
- No way to distinguish between "I need emergency help NOW" vs "I want to explore why things are happening"

#### **The Solution: 6 Session Types Based on Purpose**

When you start a new chat or voice session, you now see 6 clear options that match what you actually need:

---

**1. üí° Discovery Call** (~10 minutes) - *So I can understand you and your child*
- **Purpose**: First-time onboarding for new parents
- **What Happens**: The coach learns about your family, your child's diagnosis status, main challenges, school situation, support network
- **Why It Matters**: This context makes all future sessions better - the coach remembers your situation
- **When To Use**: Your very first session, or when starting to talk about a new child
- **Highlighted**: Shown prominently for new users who haven't completed discovery yet

---

**2. ‚ö° Quick Tip** (~5 minutes) - *Brainstorm an issue right now*
- **Purpose**: Fast advice for an immediate situation
- **What Happens**: 1-2 quick questions, then one clear strategy you can try tonight
- **Why It Matters**: Perfect for busy parents who need help *right now*
- **When To Use**:
  - "Homework meltdown happening - need help NOW"
  - "Bedtime in 10 minutes and I need a strategy fast"
  - "Quick question before I pick them up from school"

---

**3. üí¨ Update** (~15 minutes) - *Let's talk about how it's going*
- **Purpose**: Check-in conversation about progress since last session
- **What Happens**: Brief discussion of what's been working, what hasn't, quick strategy adjustments
- **Why It Matters**: Keeps momentum going between deeper sessions
- **When To Use**:
  - "We tried that morning routine strategy - some parts are working, others aren't"
  - "Quick progress update while kids are watching TV"
  - "Weekly check-in to stay on track"

---

**4. üéØ Strategy** (~30 minutes) - *Develop a strategy for a particular issue*
- **Purpose**: Focused problem-solving for a specific challenge
- **What Happens**: Clear goal, exploration of the situation, tailored strategy with implementation steps
- **Why It Matters**: Addresses specific pain points with structured approach
- **When To Use**:
  - "I need a proper plan for homework struggles"
  - "Let's tackle morning routines systematically"
  - "I want a strategy for managing emotional dysregulation"

---

**5. üö® Crisis** (~15 minutes) - *You need help now!*
- **Purpose**: Emergency support when you're overwhelmed or worried
- **What Happens**: Immediate validation, safety check, grounding, clear next step
- **Why It Matters**: Some situations can't wait - this provides urgent support
- **When To Use**:
  - "I'm completely burnt out and don't know if I can keep going"
  - "My child said something that really scared me"
  - "Everything is falling apart right now"
- **Safety First**: System checks for serious concerns (suicidal ideation, violence risk) and provides emergency resources if needed

---

**6. ‚ù§Ô∏è Coaching** (~50 minutes) - *A deeper dive to explore why things are happening*
- **Purpose**: Deep exploration using the full GROW coaching model
- **What Happens**: Extended conversation exploring patterns, exceptions, strengths, underlying factors
- **Why It Matters**: Some challenges need deep understanding before solutions make sense
- **When To Use**:
  - "I want to really understand why this keeps happening"
  - "I have dedicated time to explore this properly"
  - "We've tried strategies but nothing's working - need to dig deeper"
  - "I want to talk through my own feelings and thoughts about parenting"

#### **How Time Estimates Work Now**

Each session type has a **suggested time** that makes sense for its purpose:
- **Discovery**: 10 mins (structured onboarding)
- **Quick Tip**: 5 mins (fast advice)
- **Update**: 15 mins (progress check)
- **Strategy**: 30 mins (focused problem-solving)
- **Crisis**: 15 mins (immediate support)
- **Coaching**: 50 mins (deep exploration)

**Important**: These are estimates, not hard limits. The coach works at your pace. If a "Quick Tip" conversation naturally leads to deeper exploration and you have time, the coach adapts.

The UI shows these times as guidance: "~5 mins", "~30 mins" - making it clear they're approximate.

---

#### **Visual Design: Clear and Intuitive**

Each session type has:
- **Unique icon**: Visual distinction (Compass for Discovery, Lightning bolt for Quick Tip, etc.)
- **Color coding**: Helps with quick recognition
- **Clear description**: Explains what the session is for in plain language
- **Time badge**: Shows suggested duration
- **Selection indicator**: Visual feedback when you choose an option

**First-time user experience**:
- Discovery call is highlighted with a pink banner
- Message: "üí° First time here? Start with a Discovery call so I can understand you and your child"
- After completing discovery, this banner disappears

---

### üêõ **CRITICAL BUG FIX: Short Sessions Actually Work Now**

#### **The Bug We Found**
While implementing the new session types, we discovered a **critical bug** in the time-adaptive coaching feature we shipped yesterday:

**Short sessions weren't actually shorter** - they still required 10 conversation exchanges regardless of time selected.

This meant:
- A parent choosing "5 minutes" would be forced into a 20+ minute conversation
- A parent choosing "15 minutes" still got the full 50-minute depth requirement
- The time-adaptive feature from yesterday's update wasn't working at all

**Root cause**: The minimum conversation depth was hardcoded to 10 exchanges instead of adapting based on time budget.

#### **The Fix**
Updated the chat agent to genuinely adapt conversation depth:
- **5-minute sessions**: Require 2 exchanges (quick in/out)
- **15-minute sessions**: Require 6 exchanges (brief exploration)
- **30-minute sessions**: Require 9 exchanges (solid understanding)
- **50-minute sessions**: Require 10+ exchanges (deep dive)

Now when parents choose shorter session types (Quick Tip, Crisis, Update), they actually get shorter conversations that respect their time.

### üé§ **VOICE MODE: Now Adapts to Session Type**

Voice sessions now receive both the session type and time budget, allowing the ElevenLabs voice agent to adapt its approach:

**Technical Implementation**:
- Session type passed as `session_type` variable to ElevenLabs
- Time budget passed as `time_budget_minutes` variable
- Voice agent can adjust pacing, depth, and style based on both factors

**Example**:
- A "Quick Tip" voice session can be more direct and solution-focused
- A "Coaching" voice session can take its time with reflective listening and deep exploration

**Note**: The ElevenLabs agent prompt in their dashboard needs to be updated to use these variables (instructions provided in technical documentation).

### üìä **Behind the Scenes: Database & Architecture**

#### **New Database Schema**
Added to `agent_sessions` table:
- `session_type` column: Stores which type of session (discovery, quick-tip, update, strategy, crisis, coaching)

Added to `user_profiles` table:
- `discovery_completed`: Boolean tracking whether user has completed onboarding
- `discovery_completed_at`: Timestamp of when they finished discovery
- `diagnosis_status`: Child's diagnosis status (diagnosed, suspected, exploring, not ADHD)
- `diagnosis_details`: Details about diagnosis (when, by whom, medication)
- `main_challenges`: Array of primary challenges parent is facing
- `family_context`: Family situation (siblings, co-parenting, support)
- `school_context`: School situation (type, support, accommodations)
- `medication_status`: Medication details if applicable
- `support_network`: Array of support sources (therapists, family, groups)

#### **Configuration System**
Created central configuration file (`lib/config/session-types.ts`) defining all 6 session types with:
- Display titles and descriptions
- Icon and color assignments
- Suggested time durations
- Minimum conversation depth requirements
- Ordering logic (discovery first for new users)

#### **UI Components**
- **SessionTypeCard**: New React component replacing time selection
- Fully responsive design matching app's color palette
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- Clear visual hierarchy

#### **TypeScript Types**
Full type safety across:
- `SessionType` enum for all 6 types
- `SessionTypeConfig` interface for configuration
- Updated database interfaces for new columns
- Type-safe helper functions for ordering and filtering

## üöÄ **What's Next: Discovery Agent Implementation**

The foundation is in place - users can now select "Discovery Call" and the session is tracked in the database.

**Next step** is implementing the dedicated discovery agent that:
1. Conducts structured onboarding conversation (8-10 exchanges)
2. Collects all profile information through natural conversation
3. Saves collected data to user_profiles table
4. Marks discovery as completed
5. Provides smooth transition to other session types

This agent will follow the same pattern as existing agents (proper-tools-agent, crisis-tools-agent, strategy-agent) and integrate with the AI SDK v5 architecture.

## üìà **Impact on User Experience**

**Before**:
- "How much time do you have?" (abstract, hard to estimate)
- Choose wrong time = frustration
- No clear path for first-time users
- Short sessions didn't work (bug)

**After**:
- "What brings you here today?" (concrete, intuitive)
- Each option clearly explains its purpose
- Discovery call prominently shown for new users
- All session lengths genuinely work as advertised
- Voice mode adapts to both purpose and time

**Result**: More intuitive onboarding, better session selection, genuine time flexibility.
