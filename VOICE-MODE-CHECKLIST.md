## üìù Setup Steps (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Add to `.env.local`

Open `/Users/paulgosnell/Sites/pathfinder/adhd-support-agent/.env.local`

Add these lines:
```bash
# LiveKit Configuration
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_KEY_HERE
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud

# Speech Services
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=YOUR_DEEPGRAM_KEY_HERE
```

### Step 2: Create `voice-agent/.env.voice`

```bash
cd adhd-support-agent/voice-agent
cp .env.voice.example .env.voice
```

Edit `.env.voice`:
```bash
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_KEY_HERE
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET_HERE
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud

OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=YOUR_DEEPGRAM_KEY_HERE
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
cd adhd-support-agent/voice-agent
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for installation.

### Step 4: Test!

**Quick Test (LiveKit Playground):**
```bash
cd adhd-support-agent/voice-agent
source venv/bin/activate
python agent.py dev
```

Browser will open ‚Üí Allow microphone ‚Üí Say "Hi" ‚Üí Agent responds!

**Full Test (Your App):**

Terminal 1:
```bash
cd adhd-support-agent/voice-agent
source venv/bin/activate
python agent.py start
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
cd adhd-support-agent
npm run dev
```

Browser:
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Sign in
- Click `/voice` or use voice link in chat
- Start talking!

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Failed to get voice token"
```bash
# Check .env.local has LiveKit keys
grep LIVEKIT .env.local

# Restart Next.js
npm run dev
```

### "Voice agent won't connect"
```bash
# Check voice agent is running
# Should see: "Voice assistant started successfully"

# Verify .env.voice
cat voice-agent/.env.voice
```

### "Can't hear anything"
```bash
# Check browser permissions (microphone)
# Try different browser (Chrome works best)
# Check agent logs for errors
```

### "Poor audio quality"
```bash
# Make sure Deepgram is configured
# Check internet speed
# Try reducing background noise
```
